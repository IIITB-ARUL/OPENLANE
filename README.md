**Introduction to all components of open-source digital asic design**





**Simplified RTL2GDS flow**

**Synthesis**

  Synthesis translates the design RTL into circuits made out of components from standard cell library.Here the high level HDL code is converted into gatelevel netlist.Gatelevel netlist is the functional equivalent of RTL.

Example:

```
always @(posedge clk)
  if(c)
    q<=a;
  else
    q<=b;
```
The synthesization of the above verilog code is
